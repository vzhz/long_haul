Periodic notes about my progress.

## 9/11/2016
### Goals
Overall: Think about what core compentencies you need and how to assess what you have. Think also about what chunks tasks should be done and how they can be framed so you can stay focused, motivated and happy.

Ways there:

1. [Khan academy has a diagnostic to find the limits of your math skill](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)

2. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/)

Distractions:

I think I'm doing pretty ok here.

Neat things:

1. [The blog post I have been wanting to write about leveling up as a beginning programmer](https://www.jagtalon.com/life-after-codecademy-what-do-i-do-now-2/)
