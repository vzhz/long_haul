Periodic notes about my progress.

## 9/11/2016
### Goals
Overall: 

Think about what core compentencies you need and how to assess what you have. Think also about what chunks tasks should be done and how they can be framed so you can stay focused, motivated and happy.

Ways there:

1. [Khan academy has a diagnostic to find the limits of your math skill](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)
* Spent about 3 hours getting testing myself up to about a 5th grade level, which was surprisingly fun.  
* Painfully pulled myself away when I decided it had stopped being fun even though I had the urge hunker down and get as far as I could just to feel go about how far I got.

2. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/)

Distractions:

I think I'm doing pretty ok here. I was distracted by bacon, why isn't my email filter working, and talking to my friend about learning (which was productive, but I was doing the tab-switching dance).

Neat things:

1. [The blog post I have been wanting to write about leveling up as a beginning programmer](https://www.jagtalon.com/life-after-codecademy-what-do-i-do-now-2/)
2. Recently, a friend suggested I only work on things as long as they are interesting to increase the amount that is actually learned and motivation.  This is surprisingly hard.
3. I filtered MIT-related emails into a folder in my inbox that would bundle and arrive at 7am each morning. I felt like the sky had opened and I was given my freedom or something.
