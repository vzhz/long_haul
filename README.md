Periodic notes about my progress.

## 9/11/2016
### Goals
Overall: 

Finish the things you didn't finish yesterday, but somehow do this only until it becomes boring and move onto things you find wonderful.

Objectives:

1. [Khan academy has a diagnostic to find the limits of your math skill](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)
 * S

2. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/)
 * Be articulate about what you want and limit scope
 * [Google <country>] will show you that country's google
 * Filter your results with search tools (eg. by color with search tools>dropdown across the top>color)
 * Can use multiple filters at once in search tools (eg. name that is a make of car and a died inventor + tools>type>faces gets you pictures of the inventor)
 * If amiguous, add another word (eg. Tesla vs Tesla coil)
 * Think of what you need (eg. diagrams are often in black and white)
 * Actually searching google's index of the web, fetched with spiders
 * Asks questions to determine what you need: how many times do keywords occur on page, are the search terms in the URL, or directly agacent, does page have synonims for the search terms, what is quality of page, what is its page rank
 * Ads along right and top
 * Similar results and cached version of the page at the bottom of the description
 * Words in your search term don't have to be found near each other in the page
 * Ketword choice: think about what you are trying to find, chose words you think will appear on the page (what would the author say (for medical care, "broken arm" not "busted arm")) 
 * Insertion is extracted from some webpage to answer a question ("question answering"), not reliable yet
 * Take out the words that make it a question
 * Think of uncommon phrases that describe what you want (eg. ghost town)
 * Every word matters (eg. "who" vs "a who" vs "the who") and word order matters (eg. sky blue vs blue sky (names of businesses))
 * Capitalization doesn't matter
 * Doesn't reconize most special characters, but #, +, $, @, % ok if not by themselves (eg. #hashtag)
 * Awesome spell correction (or Veronica would never find anything) with assuming you want the famous thing and then offer "search instead for <your spelling>"
 * Find function ctrl+f for finding text on page, enter for next entry, different browsers put search in different locations
 * Scroll bar will be colored with lines at the point of the document that your search term appears
 * Using speeds search by 12%, 90% of people don't use it, tells if word appears or not (eg. person never ran in this race if name isn't on the page)
 * 
 * 
 

3. Contact Django-website-testing-folks and get yourself set up for some contributions!

4. Review nweb's math program

Distractions:

Emailed and fb'd early in the day and then one tabbed that away, consider only filling your brain with distractions later in the day as you start to get tired.  Will experiment with this.
Also matcha'd too hard this morning, and the caffine is making you feel sick.  Probably get a travel mug so you don't chug your caffine next time. :p

Neat things:

1. [Article about learning through "play"](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/08/04/diane-ackerman-deep-play/)

2. A friend had some suggestions:
 * In addition to closing fb/email when programming, I could save checking those for a later, less productive time of the day, so I'm not primed to be thinking about them in the back of my mind while I work.  He estimates this helped his squeeze like 10-15% more out of his day.  He suggests even avoiding fb on the train into work.
 * Sharing your goals with other people is super-helpful.  Seems that in the past, other governments have gotten Americans to inform on each other by starting with writing contests with relatively neutal political themes (eg. "Communism might not make sense in America, but it may make sense in [country]. Discuss.").  Winners would read their essay out loud and share them publicly.  Seems sharing your plans makes you a lot more committed.
 * Doing something that keeps your mind empty during breaks might be helpful.  He uses the [Pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and takes 5 minute breaks every 25 minutes, and suggests staring out the window or reading a (non-gripping but light-reading) book for that time.

Notes:

1. Realized that I tend to think of myself as slower than I should be (you're supposed to just wake up and be fabulous, right?) so I tend to assume I will need to grind very hard in silence in order to "catch up" and be accepted by other folks with similar goals as you.  You need to cut this out, it isn't serving you, and is keeping you from setting up positive, motivating habits.

2. Wrote your advanced statistics prof to ask about the logic covered in the course and ask for the text/chapters reviewed so you can review material you have seen before and hopefully jog your memory more quickly back to where you were 8 years ago.

### Goals
Overall: 

Think about what core compentencies you need and how to assess what you have. Think also about what chunks tasks should be done and how they can be framed so you can stay focused, motivated and happy.

Ways there:

1. [Khan academy has a diagnostic to find the limits of your math skill](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)
 * Spent about 3 hours getting testing myself up to about a 5th grade level, which was surprisingly fun.  
 * Painfully pulled myself away when I decided it had stopped being fun even though I had the urge hunker down and get as far as I could just to feel go about how far I got.

2. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/)

Distractions:

I think I'm doing pretty ok here. I was distracted by bacon, why isn't my email filter working, and talking to my friend about learning (which was productive, but I was doing the tab-switching dance).

Neat things:

1. [The blog post I have been wanting to write about leveling up as a beginning programmer](https://www.jagtalon.com/life-after-codecademy-what-do-i-do-now-2/)
2. Recently, a friend suggested I only work on things as long as they are interesting to increase the amount that is actually learned and motivation.  This is surprisingly hard.
3. I filtered MIT-related emails into a folder in my inbox that would bundle and arrive at 7am each morning. I felt like the sky had opened and I was given my freedom or something.
