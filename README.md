# the long haul
Periodic notes about my progress.

### Commitment
I recently heard someone say "you improve what you focus on, and you focus on what you can measure" and I decided it was time to start a running list of what I was working on. I made a similiar effort in 2016, and those notes are at the bottom of this document and [here]().

To support yourself in doing this, you've come up with a list of "meta-goals" that you want to put in places as supports for yourself.

## Meta-goals
Ways to support yourself as you work.
- [x] Commit to programming daily
- [ ] Explore ways to document and evaluate your progress
- [ ] Identify ways to jump-start when you fall off the wagon
- [ ] Find ways to share what you're learning, gather up moral support
- [ ] Keep a list of accomplishments, including when you reach out for help effectively, etc.

## Goals
Make an entry for each of these that you complete. These are the meat and potatoes that will help make you an self-actualized programmer.
- [ ] Complete Udacity's 

## Supports that you have
A reminder for the times I need a little help remembering.
- Your [check-in form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScujDrp6O61zeVDuEC50-3QUmoBXoHv0K1RUx9hvnLwqJHPbA/viewform)
- This record :)
- Your [assignment list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yCS4EgeFGCmW5itGtemlCE8Ng1t7s2c0BC-jrUFWF_8/edit#gid=891834841)
- Your pals have been supportive when you ask specific questions
- When you find questions of the "how do *you* do this?" type, twitter can be really helpful

### Big, Self-actualivation Goals
 * Restart the whole acountablity thing by keeping track of your progress here. To improve the experience, just delete/modify each of the items in place. This is what version control is for.
 * Try to be make sense of your list of projects that was itself becoming a distraction.

### Concrete Goals
 * Introduce yourself to: Pandas, (more with) Python debuggers, Ruby of Rails, Flask, Javascript, recursion, & the Requests library. Now sit back and just notice how many damned things you where trying to do at once. Time to trim the fat.

### Concrete Tasks
#### Contacting humans
 * Write the MR folks re: (a) do they still want to work with you (you spoke right before the election) and (b) that you have their requested summary of experience ready to go and you feel pretty ok moving forward if they feel good about it.
 * Write folks who supported you re: Outreachy and get yourself set up on their chats and start listening/developing relationships.
 * ~~Writing your GWC interviewer with a thank you and awkwardly acknowledge your mistakes.~~
 * Write DevBootcamp contact and tell her it will be a few weeks before you can get her the outline you were going to discuss.
 * Tim A re: contributing to Zulip / bummed can't make it early next week.
 * Me-like person D. met at Boston Python, now doing Outreachy.
 * ~~Tell Yuval you won't be there Weds.~~
 * ~~Write GWC folks about follow up interview~~
 * ~~Apply to [TutorNow](http://prepnow.com/about/tutor-application.php) and list Amanda as your referer~~[screenshot of app and .tex/pdf of resume can be found in [submitted jobs folder]()]
 * Apply to [Helen Fellowship, American Museum of Natural History for Women in Tech & Science](amnh.org/helen), see email for more details and contact person.
 * Apply to PyCon FinAid [Googledoc of form here, make your own copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15696r0dOYKilig6NSXNZ5hUA3uURe9hf5qO0eg1U5nM/edit?ts=5839e5a4)
 * Apply to PyCon planning committee
 * Apply to DjangoCon FinAid and look for vollenteer ops once information comes out
 * Get Soylent people to get you your refund.
 * 
 
#### Writing things to present
 * Notes about women in tech for devbootcamp 
 * Work with Sarah on Intro to Python 1-hr talk
 * Dec 9th devbootcamp talk (on "lessons from code review")
 * Try to present one thing 2/mo at RC.
 * Blog about offline news tools from your research.
 * ~~Blog about your awesome charging cord mod~~
 
#### Projects and tutorials 
 * Observe how they are all tangled and try to see what skill-attempts connect to what and start completing things.
 * For the moment, just make a static blog.  You really want a blog and the Flask/Diego fight is grinding you so just make it and then make the thing you really want later.
 * The recursive thing you wrote and played with the debugger in Python so you could debug your slowed-down version of the Sierpinski trianges. Maybe review the debugger and then take a stab at getting it to work.  You also want to give users a few more opitions and give it a front end (maybe ask Diego or Khalid about this).
 * You want to make a customized holiday card, but are a little bummed because hosting on github will not let you have a database for it.  Maybe go ahead and just start with a static for loop of the thing and the HTML/CSS you need for the front end and you can decide if the db is what you want. Remember to not to combine a new language (JS) and a project with unfamiliar components, like you where about to do.
 * Hackerrank challenge for K's company.
 * Set up RSS feed so you can join RC's [Blaggregator](https://blaggregator.recurse.com/add_blog/)
 * Set up [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none) on your blog once your internet is behaving and you can actually get to the site
 * Set up RC Scout (ask John W if you have trouble)
 * Practice interview concepts with [this hiring guide](https://www.toptal.com/python#hiring-guide) and review your observations with Edward.
 
 Rebuilding rails : I was doing this with a (more experienced) friend.  My goal was to learn about a framework by learning about it's parts by building a "toy" version of it.  This is motivated by my frustrations with Django.  My thinking was that learning about one could teach me about the other, in the same was knowing any language well helps you with others.
This is currently at a dead standstill.  My friend and I had an disagreement unrelated to programming and we're in "let's take some space" period.  I'm really hesitant to return to this project because I'm concerned I'll just end up in a dependency web without someone else there.

Holiday card : I got myself really caught up in if I should use JS etc and I haven't returned to it.  I think the thing to do is write it as if it's a terminal things in Python, since I can do that, and then figure out the front-end dance.

Playing with JS with "Ugh, Code" : It's a pretty hilarious book that has you build a weather app. I haven't any trouble with it yet. I don't have any compelling reason to learn JS right now, but Diego suggested the book and I it does seem to be a really desirable skill, especially if I do web stuff initially. I am somewhat more motivated to do this because I know Diego will talk to me about anything I do with it.

Exploring Pandas with Julia Evan's cookbook : There was no reason to stop, I just got distracted. I just want to get more comfortable with Pandas, because data.

Chat client with ballingt's tutorial : I wanted to make a chat client with Python. I went to a workshop but it was almost to packed to type and I got behind very fast, so I wanted to go back to it.

Python debugger -> Triangle drawing script : I want to fix the "slowed-down" version of my script, but it's not working (and I'm not sure when it last was and past, less-organized me wrote it).  So I should probably play more with the debugger and attempt to figure out why my mess isn't working. But really the real point should be getting confident with debugger tools.

Webpage : I've been playing with my webpage quite a bit, and that it's been reasonably positive, although I don't know how long-term goal focused that is.  I'm going to work out some CSS problems with a friend on Friday and then I'll be happy to show off.  I recently broke a few things.

 
#### Things that aren't actually about you
 * ~~Getting folks with intermittent internet set up with a way to download articles to read later.~~
 * ~~Maybe talk to the meetup girl whose code you were going to review and make suggestions for next steps and gently that she may want to distinguish between her work and tutorials when asking for feedback.~~
 * Review the rock game for the geology of it.
 * ~~Find and send parents [the info for calling their reps.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174f0WBSVNSdcQ5_S6rWPGB3pNCsruyyM_ZRQ6QUhGmo/htmlview?sle=true#gid=114941615)~~
 * ~~Make sure you can record and save 45mins of video on your phone for D's talk Monday.~~ ~~[Open Camera](http://opencamera.sourceforge.net/help.html) is a great (and open source!) app.  Also used [this web app](https://www.digitalrebellion.com/webapps/videocalc?format=dv_ntsc_f&frame_rate=f23.98&length=1&length_type=hours) to calcuation how many GBs would be needed at what res. etc.~~
 * Learn pricepoint for hiking shirts in the past and fine a good fabric/how to print. Asked how many sold last year. Next: Contact [Hemlock Ink](http://www.hemlockink.com/digital-printing/) and ask them what shirt material options are and Alex G (who just ordered for SoR) to see what his experience was and if he got a deal.
 * ~~Correct grammar in Daisy's research applications.~~
 
#### Stuff to make you better
 * Read The Will to Change
 * Read Strangers in their own Land [Ordered]
 * Watch [this video about scaling yourself that Diego recommended](https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_smith_why_you_will_fail_to_have_a_great_career?language=en#t-529593) and [this other talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS1mnISoG7U)
 * Watch [the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wewAC5X_CZ8) Deborah suggested
 * Read the public speaking book
 * Watch Real Boys Don't Cry. Cry.


## 10/12/2016
### Goals
Overall: 
Code and get organized/priorities.

Objectives:
1. Tell supportive folks about your Outreachy choices, ask how you might contact people and increase your chances in future rounds.
 * Open Stack - giant project, ambitious long-term participants; if interested in OpenStack, check out [this course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS152x+3T2016/info)
 * EdX - hires (Boston) from it's open people a lot (NB)
 * Debian - (CS)
 * Zulip - 
 * [Google doc of all notes on orgs/projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MRHQ04r7CPT4LAujFWHFcBHPt7G5wtnPivP0zueNb9U/edit#gid=0)

2. Try cloned flask blog locally, modify as needed (or use to troubleshoot your own), and add to website.

3. Send review for meetup friend.

4. Get a twilio project started.
 * Hack and Tell organizer works there so maybe you could be bros and ask her things.
 * Maybe have it send the same affirmations you have for friendly terminal to your phone.
 * **[Official tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials)**
 
5. Screening call with travel company in Amsterdam this morning was successful.  Next step is a HackerRank challenge.
 * Wrote and asked them to send screening.
 
6. Looked into TechWeek NYC events and decided that the event isn't worth it unless you are going to volenteer and get into the higher-priced events for free. [Done and calendared for next year]
 
7. Pandas tutorial on the way to Pandas+Elastic Search project.
 * Sarah can review your things and may have resource suggestions.  Deborah has also used Elastic before.
 * Sarah suggests [Python for Data Science](http://www3.canisius.edu/~yany/python/Python4DataAnalysis.pdf)
 * **[Official tutorial](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html), using Cookbook by Julia Evens**
 * Downloaded Anaconda, and opened iPython Notebooks and got started.
 * maybe have a pandas party with Diego sometime?
  
8. Plan gentle troll for person who made first commit to your repo when you were just getting started. 
 * Idea: Maybe make scripted commits every day for a week or something so he gets an email each time.  Need to do some research about how to make this happen.
 * Could also also Zulip for ideas. 
 * Do this later.

9. Invited to RtR tech talk night so can go and talk to folks.
 * Figure out if you can go and tell the person who invited you.
 * Asked to be invited to next demo night, might meet him this weekend.  Come to Demos on Friday.  Pinged Nancy to chat about their current needs.
 
10. Investigate [open source resource](https://www.codetriage.com/?language=Python) Edward suggested.
 * Remember his advice about looking for ways to support projects you like using whatever expertice you are (ie. he upgraded the website for [this project](http://rouge.jneen.net/)).
 * Honestly, looking though this list is a really great way to learn about projects that are established but you haven't heard about for whatever reasons.
 * I want to contribute to [LetsEncrypt](https://www.codetriage.com/letsencrypt/), but am intimidated because most of the issues that seem like low-hanging fruit (ie. posting their logo on the readme) have several comments including 99% test coverage (so it's done and tested?) but still not closed.
 * Asked about the [logo issue which confuses you](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/3610).  See if they answer you kindly.  Yes, it's a test.
 * They never responded but zulip folks explained that since the test ceverage didn't change before/after the addition, they were using this to point out that no fewer tests were passing so the addition happened without breaking anything else, not that the logo addition itself was tested and less than 100% passing.
 
11. Look through [Michelle's resume editing project](https://github.com/Yuffster/i17on) [[slides](http://slides.com/yuffster/deck-1#/1)] and decide how you will contribute.
 * Wrote Michelle and asked for contribution wish list which she had in presentation but isn't on github.
 * Forked so it's sitting and reminds you. :p
 * Next step, maybe ask her to post issues and start commenting on one so people know you are working on it and then get to work.  Also maybe after looking it over with Diego ask Michelle to walk thought the hard parts with you.
 * [Contribution wish list](http://slides.com/yuffster/deck-1#/35)
 * **I am most attracted to the Markdown problem, but need to think more about what that entails. [<-- Next step]**

12. Review the technologies needed for the climate-change project and consider what you have now and make goals that bring you closer to being able to contribute to that. Here is the list:
 * Web-based user interface: Javascript with jQuery, which sends AJAX requests.
 * Webpage elements: HTML templates in using Mako, to be served by UI.
 * Python controller: Serves the main page and responds to AJAX requests from the UI, written in the TurboGears 2 web framework (Pylons), using Python 2.7.
 * Database: MongoDB table, consisting of a dictionary tree structure, accessed through Ming’s ODM interface.
 * Model estimation: Python to generate Stata .do code.
 * Results generation: Python to call the DMAS generator functions system.
 * **How to gain experience with each of these?  <-- think about this and make goals to address at least two of these before contacting James again**
 * Full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103DzpZbFxFrvFTp6fwpbhMS1JsZh880sQ5gJquAqiTM/edit?usp=sharing).


13. Ask your AWS-knowing-gang (Michele) what tutorials they would recommend to move you closer to your own projects.
 * Diego suggested [this open guide](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws).
 * You have also attended Getting Started in AWS, but would benefit from review and completing a full, sans-tutorials project.
 * Advice from earlier: AWS services you absolutely should learn how to use: DynamoDB, EC2 (i.e. spinning up instances, etc.), AWS Lambda, Route 53, S3, CloudWatch, Redshift, Elastic search, Elastic file system (I think this is called something else now but it is mega cool), SQS (IMO less cool than RabbitMQ / ZeroMQ, but it integrates with AWS so....).
 * In order, suggest: S3, EC2, Elastic Search, Route 53
 * [Site for the certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)
 * [AWS in plain English](https://www.expeditedssl.com/aws-in-plain-english)
 * Decided you are most interested in making a sensor that will AWS it up and tell you if your plant needs to be watered.  A tutorial is at [this site](https://www.hackster.io/heskew/aws-iot-remote-soil-moisture-monitor-860040) and you should order materials for at least two of these and plan to do this in December or so.
 * Maybe you can write a guest blog post for mom's site.
 * Next step: Order supplies for this (ask RC-folks if they want to joint-order) and get it in your calendar. [scheduled for tonight]
 * Put this off for now.  The most expensive parts sans shipping were >$70 and you mostly want it for the AWS and the confidence anyway.  Maybe check in with yourself about this in Feb. or so.
 
14. Check in with GWC about teaching for them next summer in NYC or Boston.
 * Keep in touch with Kayla and the hiring person you had contact with before.  Maybe also get in touch with Jessica Ford from the Work Jelly/MIT since she's discussed it.
 * Understand that they often hiring from the hosting company because those hires have worked out well in the past.
 * Note: [Speaking opperunity](https://girlswhocode.com/volunteer/) for folks to talk to the girls about inspiring stuff for an hour.  Signed up and will think of topic when you get pinged.
 * Contacted Chrissy and asked if the hiring process has changed (their interest link is broken) and signed up to read apps and teach their curriculm during the year at a local club. <-- check back ~Nov 1
 * Draft of cover letter is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ynfvsJcJ9U3kVw13eTssRnoBE0cHYM_W8M0JhIpmY0/edit?usp=sharing)
 
14. Make a list to talk to update Edward with tomorrow. [this is over]
 * Ask him for help intigrating your blog with your website.
 
15. Talk ideas for dev bootcamp lightning talks [[link to application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSem42m0T66X-uk4ucLne9wDwdxJ6UAc0Sgm4oYX2eMiEUG0XA/viewform)]
 * For perspective, I have already spoken about Friendly Terminal and imposter's syndrome (both recorded).
 * Wrote supportive pals and asked for feedback on talk list.
 * Additionally, wrote the organizer and asked if she would like me to make a presentation about gender and learning programming to her instructors.  She said yes!
 * **Research and outline talk about gender in programming teaching**
 * Once talk is selected, write the thinger (talk date is Dec. 6).  Submissions can be found in [submitted talks](https://github.com/vzhz/long_haul/edit/master/submitted_talks) folder.  Can ask Jacinda and Jess Hamerick about titles/for review.  Also see if you can record your screen + voice.
 * The talk idea list: 
  * How the http requests library works (you used it in your scraper), and the docs are pretty short. [1 vote, submitted this]
  * Building something simple and modularly building up from that (maybe use flashcard as an example). 
  * PEP8 is awesome but isn’t life (include some of this things that auto-PEP8 for you)
  * Comparison of Django and Flask by writing same program in both [1 vote, Kayla wants to see it!]
  * Lessons in gutsiness and self-perception from "Unlocking the Clubhouse" [1 vote]
  * What you can learn from reviewing other's code [submitted this]
  * Common hurtles for beginners (since these will all be bootcamp grads, I could make it funny)
  * How to get started in open source
  * How and why of pointers
  
16. Asked my wonderful artist-friend Andy M. to illistrate anything that needs illistrating when I start blogging.
 * She's happy to do so and requests that I tell her more about what I will blog about so she can start sketching.
 * I want to be sure she uses materials that will move her forward in her art-study since I'll be happy with whatever she does.
 
17. **Write bio+pick pic for Colgate career services feature**

18. Job-finding resources
 * [Stack share matching](http://stackshare.io/match)
 
19. Learned what a canary is. : thumbs up :

20. Refactor triangle generator
 * Maybe just rewrite the whole thing.  Here's what you hope to have it do:
 * Maybe give it a form-like front page explaining purpose and a sketch of what they are seeing in the slowed down one.
 * Ask user if they'd like to see construction of triangle or pyrimid at normal speed or a pyrimid at the slow speed.
 * After showing the fast versions, ask again if they want to see the slow version.
 * Decided to refactor instead of rewriting the whole thing after talking to several folks.  They had some interesting 

21. Project: Scaling for the sake of scaling
 * Notes: 
 * Twitter clone is a good project because you need to concern yourself with caching, load balancing, and accepting/displaying permutations.  Can monitor time needed to view with a given number of users.
 * Can have a simple site that shows images using google API for like 1000 images with dominant color tagged.  Users (lots of them) can request a color.
 * If use existing scraper project, can time and use caching results.  Data.gov datasets the quickest dataset to interact with.
 * Advice: Make what people use the most fast.  Make the app itself very straightforward.  n+1 query helps you optimize.  Could scale someone else's code since you just care about scaling.  Remember to get baseline and speed it up.  Read articles to get terminology in your head.

22. Apply to ADA

23. Wrote re: fixing MITOC admin stuff [Done]

24. Should also sign up MITOC as an org this week [David did this]

25. Learned about [meditation beads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_prayer_beads) from Matthias

26. Went to talk about moderating vulva project (see phone images for notes)

27. Reviewed ohmyzsh features and suggested directory/organizational structure with Diego
 * ohmyzsh [project](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) especially the [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) are really worth looking at
 * suggest only using plugins with docs so you know what you're getting
 * themes are neat but mostly it's just art, look for functional things (like showing what branch you are on)
 * I look forward to having a config file that I'm proud of :)
 * D. says vim folks use ohmyzsh a lot because it means that the stuff they don't get by not using emacs can still hapen, just in their terminal 
 * z has a really neat [fuzzy search tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) that means that you don't need to play the cd into your directory game that I always play
 * suggest git, z, pep8, and a few other plugins. omg, this can control spotify from your terminal <3
 * get comfortable using spotlight [crtl+space] to get used to z and give yourself another way to avoid your mouse
 * how you plan your directory structure allows you to control how you allocate resources (sync each with best services for that thing (eg. pics with google, docs with dropbox, projects with github)) and keep yourself from getting distracted by looking for things or not remembering what projects you were working on
 * suggests keeping projects that are completed in an arcived folder so you can more easily see the ones that are incomplete, renaming the folder projects instead of git because you really dont want all your projects on github do you - this is a way to change your outlook since you do projects to do projects and not for github, clean github periodically of all but the projects you are proudest of because people will only come and click on 2-3 projects so you want the chances to be high that they see something you want them to see
 * suggested structure: documents (for mostly written things: mitoc notes, books, funny written things), media (pics (whatever kind or however I will use them (ie. silly pictures to cheer me up)), videos), projects (archived, maybe discarded, and a scratchpad folder where all the bonkers ideas get tried out) 
 * noticed I end up with a lot of minimized windows because I minimize things so I can see my desktop, can instead [cmd+f3] for fast clearing or [cmd+f3+shift] for slow clearing and repeat or click on edge of window to get it back
 
28. Apply to Code with Klossy


 
 
## 10/6/2016
### Goals
Overall: 
Code and do a little planning.

Objectives:

1. Try cloned flask blog locally, modify as needed (or use to troubleshoot your own), and add to website.
 * 

2. Review task planner for new meetup friend.
 * She's also excited about my website design and I told her she could folk and play around if she wanted, thinking of other good resources
 * Import statements are redundent
 * Should tell users either in Readme or inline comments if they need to run a particular python version or install anything (note: tk is picky about this https://pythonspot.com/en/tk-message-box/)
 * Since it's so hard to decide what to install point to resource that helps figure out versions, etc.
 * Consider that the code was never run locally without being commited, wrote person to ask if it runs on her computer
 * Potentially helpful links: http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter
 * Future her will want only the comments that are needed
 * Comments should be formatted consistently (point to PEP8 but maybe also the "you don't have to follow every rule" talk as an awareness thing
 * If used tutorial (line-by-line) consider pointing to tutorial link and then pointing out what features you added yourself as you adapt code to your own needs/desires
 * Reminder to run code every time and maybe suggest print statements at points to decide what's up when need to debug
 * Return to this after you can run the code

3. Review possible outreachy projects with an eye for Python, projects with tags for beginners, and helpful documentation.
 * Send to Satabdi Das (who will reach out on the mailing list and introduce me to past participants). She suggests to apply to two projects (can branch out to others) and points out that documentation or marketing is helpful too.
 
4. Get [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) up and sending some texts using some Python 
 * Can check in with Deborah, Edward, and Matthias who have all used it
 * Chat with company is next Friday
 * 

5. Sarah asked me to review her bio for Boston Code Camp <3 

6. I scrubbed the mildew/mold off the shower. Observe my cleanliness.

## 10/6/2016
### Goals
Overall: 
Code and do a little planning.

Objectives: 

1. Try cloned flask blog locally, modify as needed (or use to troubleshoot your own), and add to website.

2. Review task planner for new meetup friend.

3. Review possible outreachy projects with an eye for Python, projects with tags for beginners, and helpful documentation.

4. Intro to D3 with RC folk, [notes](https://zulip-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/13/0ro8ur1ETu49F9m_UgM97wBp/D3intro.html?Signature=XmrUmaP%2B%2B5Qcu4%2By2LprYgTBcPE%3D&Expires=1475860835&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIEVMBCAT2WD3M5KQ)
 * Recent version v4 came in June, naming is different so old tutorials need to be translated
 * More tutorials for v3 but v4 is more recent
 * Docs on 3D.org site are current
 * can't just copy/paste your data in and see it
 * 3d good at mapping length/height/etc to your data attributes, but making those relationships is hard to get your head around
 * easier to learn with JS knowledge
 * ES6, etc. means that it is a version of JS
 * mapping data onto html element or svg (Scalable Vector Graphics - eg. squares etc) element
 * divide 
 * tributary.io helps you see what selectors
 * really helpful to use inspect elements when using D3, D3 will create your elements for you so you can check for them inside your inspect element to troubleshoot when you don't see what you expect
 * maybe it is easier to learn without chaining at first (append as a second step) but all the examples have a lot of chains
 * make sure to name your collections of items and then you will change your attributes (circles will stay circles even if they multiply, turn red, etc.)
 * select and select all are the two ways to select, select all will not select things but it will make a place to collect those things, which is weird to think about
 * make a cheat sheet of commands to make collections that don't exist - very smart

5. Dynamic programming talk by James Katz, [slides](https://github.com/james727/Dynamic-Programming-Workshop)
 * Hard to know what is a dynamic programming problems
 * Foscus this time on getting formulation right, coding comes easier
 * Problems selected are famous
 * Richard Bellman, father of dynamic programming needed a good name that didn't sound like research 
 * Bellman-Ford algorium
 * Motivation: recursive formulation is in definition of the problem but niave solution is going to take a very long time
 * Sometimes get a list of integers and need to find the ones with some property and in that case there is no notion of sequentialness
 * Not just considering location but also which house is bigger (and you can steal more money from)
 * Use answer from subproblem (2) and have that be your starting house
 * Memoization keep answers off to the side in a dictionary and check if you solved the problem before
 * Python3 has a memoized decorator 0_o 


## 9/16/2016
### Goals
Overall: 

Code. Hopefully mostly Django.

Objectives:

 * Context helps when search results give more than ask for 
 * Knowledge panel is basic information about the thing (all clickable items), useful in supporting your search
 * Autocomplete is driven by what others have searched (in the dropdown)
 * Google instant fills in results for the search you are starting (in the browser page) - you may be able to reconize the thing you are looking for
 * Searches related to might get you thinking outside your box (ie. family name but doesn't include the name itself
 * Read more carefully: don't skip words you don't know (define: <word>)
 * Grey arrow widget gives more information about word (timeline of use, etc.)
 * Can use words not in dictonaries because defined by content on the web
 * Lots of content on google, blended into search results webpage
 * Look beyond the webpage for insights: related searches (at bottom), different media types
 * Different media types: images (along top), news
 * If first results are videos, check out the video tab and choose what looks best
 * Reading Search Engine Results Page
 * If new to a subject break down question into single questions (ie. if unsure of definition)
 * Open links in different tabs (cmd+click)
 * Words in query and snippet will be bold in the snippet
 * Downward arrow will tell about the website/org etc. - way to get quick sense of how authitative that sourse is
 * ... means something has been removed and maybe information that would be helpful to you has been deleted
 * Links at bottom are places within that webpage that people go to (results from within the site)
 * If results seem to contriduct each other mean you need to investigate further 
 * Tools to look for patents, scholar, etc. to search for those types of content
 * More dropdown offers Google books, etc.
 * Can search for google books etc so not have to remember the URL
 * Patents searches use advanced tab
 * Legal content only in English so switch to English as your input language
 
2. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/) [Unit 3]
 * Google can crawl visible web, non-indexed is deep web
 * Operator filters your results (ie. "tesla coil site:standford.edu"), when you need a particular thing from a particular place
 * site: operator used as domain (.edu) and website levels
 * filetype: operator limits results
 * Can import kml file to maps (neat sidebar)
 * Format [query terms filetype:<type>]
 * - operator filters to exclude certain results
 * Format [query -<irrelevent sense of the word> -<ingrediant you don't like>]
 * No space after minus sign or will emphasize that word
 * When exact phrase "<phrase>"
 * "<blah blah "blah">" good way to avoid similar spellings, means third blah will not be spell corrected
 * OR adds more results to your search, Ex. Fish spa OR pedicure, bolded term in summary is the term that was used
 * intext: operator makes sure text is on the page
 * Important because not all terms are always included, sometimes page ranks highly enough based on first terms that you get that page without considering later terms
 * Settings to go to advanced search and will be populated with your search
 * If you forget operators, etc., come here
 
3. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/) [Unit 4]
 * Search-by-image (search internet for images) : click image search in upper right, drag image into search bar
 * Where from, what is it? Example of tool-like item on white background because assuming will be in catalog
 * search "Google Search Features" for complete list of shortcuts
 * Conversions: X units in units that interest you
 * Won't give you length into volume, instead gives pages that mention both conversions
 * Can do lovely 3D graphs of equations
 * Easter egg is asking questions and adding the answer (ex. Number of horns a unicorn has + the lonliest number)
 * Subpanel can change location, any time (time page was published to web, can have custom range using wiget to see how the world felt about a thing in a certain time range)
 * Examples of previous unit skills: California OR CA intext: other politician from that time
 * To learn what others think, search in their language using advanced search menu
 * Bar along the top will over to translate to your default language - can go back and forth
 * Text in images aren't translated
 * Can define a region in addition to a language so in Spanish served from Mexico for example
 * Better to search for the translated word instead of in English 
 * If you paste URL into google translate, will give new, translated URL

## 9/15/2016
### Goals
Overall: 

Review code today and think broadly about what you should be doing.

Objectives:

1. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/) [Unit 2]
 * 

3. Review math program
 * My copy of my review can be found [here](https://github.com/rczyrnik/MathProgram/compare/master...vzhz:codereview).
 * I struggled a little about keeping track of which branch I was on and how to push to a practular branch from my cloned repo that I had forked from her.  There is a good review of the process [here](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).
 * This reminded me of what I am comfortable with and what I'm not, and I hope to remember that as I go forward.
 * I also asked the pairing stream at Recurse to review my review, since I want to be able to improve my clarity.
 * Next time I think I will comment in github and not inline so no one has to delete my comments in the future, but I decided that this was the way I did it and it was time to move on instead of "perfecting" something that doesn't change much for the other person even though it would take me a lot of time.

4. Work on Django blog
 * 
 
5. Lightning talk tonight about cell phone transition
 * Decided to cancel and stay home for all roommates stay home day instead.  The talk was going to be amusing but wouldn't benefit you like the work you got done.  Go you.

6. Counting review with Recurser
 * Rescheduled because of stay home decision.

7. Django website contribution
 * Asked a question about one of the issues on the depricated version of their website (oops)
 * Tried to identify a issue to tackle for the current site

Distractions:

I think it would be a helpful to take notes thoughout the day as I was doing before.

## 9/13/2016
### Goals
Overall: 

Get some coding done today.  That's what you really want to do.

Objectives:

1. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/) [Unit 2]
 * 
 
2. Get math materials for probability course review
 * Old math prof suggested reviewing the combinatorics/counting sections of “A First Course in Probability” by Sheldon Ross (Ch. 1) and then attempt to read Knuth.
 * In the course, text was “A First Course in Probability” by Sheldon Ross and we covered chapters 1-5, the first half of 6, parts of 10.
 * Hard copy of the book is [on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/FAST-SHIP-A-First-Course-in-Probability-9E-by-Sheldon-Ross-/262440734464?hash=item3d1aafcf00:g:6JAAAOSwXSJXOkLw) but there is also [this pdf](http://zalsiary.kau.edu.sa/Files/0009120/Files/119387_A_First_Course_in_Probability_8th_Edition.pdf).  Nothing in the NYC/Brooklyn public libraries, but now you have a library card on the way.  Pdf now downloaded onto your desktop.
 * Found a buddy to work with at RC on Thursday!
 * Try to review some on Weds so you're ready to pair.

3. Review nweb's math program
 * 

4. Work on Django blog
 * 
 
5. Thought of future talk/lightning talk ideas

Technical:

 * How the http requests library works
 * Webscraping in Python (project review + best practices/how-to)
 * Building something simple and modularly building up from that 
 * When PEP8 is and isn’t helpful (Python specific)
 * Review of “Unlocking the Clubhouse” (short talk)

Non-technical:

 * Lessons I learned helping with rover landing site selection 
 * Learning to fly and how it is like any other learning process (I need to think about how to frame this, but it could be awesome)
 * Comical talk about switching from a dumb phone to a smart one
 * Somedat I want to share my favorite life hacks

Tabled: 

1. [Khan academy has a diagnostic to find the limits of your math skill](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)

Distractions:

I started getting the white lights in the corner of my eyes thing.  It was so bad that when I took a "please be better, eyes" walk and visited a shop, it was hard to talk to the saleslady because I couldn't see her very well.  Not the best thing.

Neat things:

1. Went to PythonNYC meetup for like 20 minutes and talked to a Recurser who suggested you watch [Destroy All Software's talk on Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries) to better be able to apply the counting you will be doing with him.

Notes:

1. Spent a non-trivial amount of time figuring out travel to Boston, Airbnb stuff, etc.

2. Django project guy didn't write me back, should I just do a small PR or wait (I assume he's just busy)

3. Totally didn't try not checking my email in the morning.  Eye pain meant I let myself work on brainless stuff (Airbnb, etc) alot. :/

## 9/12/2016
### Goals
Overall: 

Finish the things you didn't finish yesterday, but somehow do this only until it becomes boring and move onto things you find wonderful.

Objectives:

1. [Khan academy has a diagnostic to find the limits of your math skill](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)
 * Nope, didn't

2. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/) [Unit 1]
 * Be articulate about what you want and limit scope
 * [Google <country>] will show you that country's google
 * Filter your results with search tools (eg. by color with search tools>dropdown across the top>color)
 * Can use multiple filters at once in search tools (eg. name that is a make of car and a died inventor + tools>type>faces gets you pictures of the inventor)
 * If amiguous, add another word (eg. Tesla vs Tesla coil)
 * Think of what you need (eg. diagrams are often in black and white)
 * Actually searching google's index of the web, fetched with spiders
 * Asks questions to determine what you need: how many times do keywords occur on page, are the search terms in the URL, or directly agacent, does page have synonims for the search terms, what is quality of page, what is its page rank
 * Ads along right and top
 * Similar results and cached version of the page at the bottom of the description
 * Words in your search term don't have to be found near each other in the page
 * Ketword choice: think about what you are trying to find, chose words you think will appear on the page (what would the author say (for medical care, "broken arm" not "busted arm")) 
 * Insertion is extracted from some webpage to answer a question ("question answering"), not reliable yet
 * Take out the words that make it a question
 * Think of uncommon phrases that describe what you want (eg. ghost town)
 * Every word matters (eg. "who" vs "a who" vs "the who") and word order matters (eg. sky blue vs blue sky (names of businesses))
 * Capitalization doesn't matter
 * Doesn't reconize most special characters, but #, +, $, @, % ok if not by themselves (eg. #hashtag)
 * Awesome spell correction (or Veronica would never find anything) with assuming you want the famous thing and then offer "search instead for <your spelling>"
 * Find function ctrl+f for finding text on page, enter for next entry, different browsers put search in different locations
 * Scroll bar will be colored with lines at the point of the document that your search term appears
 * Using speeds search by 12%, 90% of people don't use it, tells if word appears or not (eg. person never ran in this race if name isn't on the page)

3. Contact Django-website-testing-folks and get yourself set up for some contributions!

4. Review nweb's math program

Distractions:

Emailed and fb'd early in the day and then one tabbed that away, consider only filling your brain with distractions later in the day as you start to get tired.  Will experiment with this.
Also matcha'd too hard this morning, and the caffine is making you feel sick.  Probably get a travel mug so you don't chug your caffine next time. :p

Neat things:

1. [Article about learning through "play"](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/08/04/diane-ackerman-deep-play/)

2. A friend had some suggestions:
 * In addition to closing fb/email when programming, I could save checking those for a later, less productive time of the day, so I'm not primed to be thinking about them in the back of my mind while I work.  He estimates this helped his squeeze like 10-15% more out of his day.  He suggests even avoiding fb on the train into work.
 * Sharing your goals with other people is super-helpful.  Seems that in the past, other governments have gotten Americans to inform on each other by starting with writing contests with relatively neutal political themes (eg. "Communism might not make sense in America, but it may make sense in [country]. Discuss.").  Winners would read their essay out loud and share them publicly.  Seems sharing your plans makes you a lot more committed.
 * Doing something that keeps your mind empty during breaks might be helpful.  He uses the [Pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and takes 5 minute breaks every 25 minutes, and suggests staring out the window or reading a (non-gripping but light-reading) book for that time.

Notes:

1. Realized that I tend to think of myself as slower than I should be (you're supposed to just wake up and be fabulous, right?) so I tend to assume I will need to grind very hard in silence in order to "catch up" and be accepted by other folks with similar goals as you.  You need to cut this out, it isn't serving you, and is keeping you from setting up positive, motivating habits.

2. Wrote your advanced statistics prof to ask about the logic covered in the course and ask for the text/chapters reviewed so you can review material you have seen before and hopefully jog your memory more quickly back to where you were 8 years ago.

3. Attended License with Confidence at Emacs NYC
 * Shouldn't we just throw it out there because free as in freedom?
 * Publishing gives automatic copywrite
 * Liseance protects you and let's everyone know how you want them to use it
 * Four freedoms (open source) : run, study, redistribute, improve
 * Proprietary (EULA) isn't what we're talking about (they are more restrictive, can run (rarely other three), crazy clauses (itunes at one time said can't build numclear weapon with this))
 * consider: linking, patent claims, distributing, modification, ...
 * apharo : if make mods have to send them upsteam
 * copyright vs copyleft : public domain (can't be copywrited: old books), permissive (MIT, BSD, Mozilla, ISC), weak copyleft (LGPL - using is isnt recissarily derivitive), strong copyleft (GPL, AGPL - if you use any of this code, the whole project becomes this thing, called "the virus" by microsoft)
 * modification: do changes get sent upstream
 * permissive liscenses allowed to be made less premissive later - might need to go back to time when it was less restrictive and use that version, in case of derivitive project can make more restrictive and then people choose which to contribute to 
 * Public domain: Do What The Fuck You Want (just need to change the name when you redistrube), the Unlicense
 * MIT: practically public domain, linking, no warranty, must maintain original license/copywrite
 * BSD: nearly same as MIT, maintail list of contrubtors, 3clases version has non-endorsement clause (cant use who worked on it to sell it), no warranty
 * Apache 2.0: permissive MIT/BSD, requires changelog, clauses for patent release, BSD non-endorsement clause, if you try to patent you can't use the software
 * GPL: beastly license, 2nd most popular to MIT, provides rules to be copyleft
 * GPLv2 (came one year after GPL): cannot sublicense, stong copyleft (linking, modification, distrubution), allows private copies, patent infridgement, not compatible with Apache2.0 (which has more restrictive patent clause)
 * GPLv3: similar to GPLv2, if own hardware need to be able to change the software running on it, allows creation of private copies, allows removal of DRM that is added, prevents Tivoization, prevents patent infridgement
 * Affero GNU Public License: same as GPLv3, fixes application service provider loophole, for network software, no private copies
 * Content licences (video, images, documentations, general authoring...) 
 * GNU Free Document License): similar to GPL, GPL can also be used for docs, restricts use of DRM...
 * Creative Commons: most permissive to view only, based on US legal code (now expanded), all works falling under copyright, not recommended for software, can be combinated to make super-license

## 9/11/2016
### Goals
Overall: 

Think about what core compentencies you need and how to assess what you have. Think also about what chunks tasks should be done and how they can be framed so you can stay focused, motivated and happy.

Ways there:

1. [Khan academy has a diagnostic to find the limits of your math skill](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)
 * Spent about 3 hours getting testing myself up to about a 5th grade level, which was surprisingly fun.  
 * Painfully pulled myself away when I decided it had stopped being fun even though I had the urge hunker down and get as far as I could just to feel go about how far I got.

2. [Learn to be a master-googler](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/)

Distractions:

I think I'm doing pretty ok here. I was distracted by bacon, why isn't my email filter working, and talking to my friend about learning (which was productive, but I was doing the tab-switching dance).

Neat things:

1. [The blog post I have been wanting to write about leveling up as a beginning programmer](https://www.jagtalon.com/life-after-codecademy-what-do-i-do-now-2/)
2. Recently, a friend suggested I only work on things as long as they are interesting to increase the amount that is actually learned and motivation.  This is surprisingly hard.
3. I filtered MIT-related emails into a folder in my inbox that would bundle and arrive at 7am each morning. I felt like the sky had opened and I was given my freedom or something.

Notes:
